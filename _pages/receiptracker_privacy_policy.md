Receipt Tracker allows you to take photos of receipts. These are sent securely to:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS API Gateway)**
- **Google Gemini API**

These services return structured data (JSON), which is **stored locally on your device**.

ðŸš« We do **not** store or process this data on our servers. You remain in full control.

- [AWS Privacy Notice](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)

We have **no control** over how they use or store your data.

Local storage is managed by your device and operating system. You are responsible for securing your device.
