# Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: 23 december 2024

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how World Government Bonds ("the App") handles and processes information when you use it.

## 1. Data We Collect

### No Personal Data Collected
The App does not collect, store, or process any personal information from its users. 

## 2. Data Usage

The App fetches bond price data from a third-party API to display the information directly to you. This data is retrieved in real-time and is not stored or processed beyond its immediate purpose.

### API Interaction
The App makes API calls to a service to fetch bond prices. These interactions are limited to retrieving the data necessary to display bond prices within the App. No data from the user is sent to the API.

## 3. Security

The App is designed to ensure the secure transmission of data from the API provider to the App. However, since the App does not collect or store user data, there is no personal information at risk.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the App or on our website. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
