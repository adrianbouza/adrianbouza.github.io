This project is still a work in progress. It is a quiz game with geographic questions which I started as a side project, but it became bigger than I though. From this project I derived to the Simple TableUI plugin, because I needed a scoreboard.

The most tedious part of this project is setting all the different country maps, region maps,rivers ... It can become boring and, in order to make  the assets as light as posible, I decided to choose vector graphics for the map, so that the map can have high resolution without using too much space. Unity provides a plugin for working with vector graphics, and it was pretty easy to work with them. This kind of files won't behave exactly as the typical sprite image but it's close enough for what I needed.

After setting a few maps I started to make the quizs and menus because, once I established a backbone of the game, all the new quizs would consist on adding more maps and questions.

So, at this point there are a few quizs made, but the menus and game in general still needs a lot of polishing and styling.

This project is in standby as I am working in the TableUI project but I hope to return to it soon enough.
