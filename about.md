## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/about_pic.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

My name is Adri√°n Bouza, I am a developer from Spain who is interested in Web Applications, Game Developing, Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Applications, ... I've made this page because I would like to share my work and improvements and I'll be very happy if anyone found it helpful.

I have a degree in Computing Engineer and I also have work for almost a year as a Software Developer. I've tried many technologies especially in the field of Web Applications, I'm no expert but I try to learn something new in each project that I make. 

As much as I love Game Developing, right now it is more of a hobby, most of my time I work as a Software Developer, designing and mantaining Web Applications. I've worked with multipe technologies like Java and it's multiple frameworks (Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, JPA, Spring Boot), a little of .NET, Android Studio, Ionic, ...

And I also have a little knowledge with Artificial Intelligence, I've worked with neural networks in Matlab and Python, image recognition, decision trees, ... 

### What will be the main content of the posts
<div class="box">
  <p>
    The main idea behind this page is to share my projects. The majority of projects that I will be posting here are probably going to be related to Unity and Game Development.
